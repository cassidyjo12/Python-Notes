Ejected from the womb, unrestrained, I'm catching the wind
Unfolded fire blows with the words, straight from within
The second I was born, I found a shelter deep in my own
I ventured further out on the edge of the glacier

This is how we talk to the world
Pure liquid fire running through our veins
We're in this alone, we bow to no one
Carved by the waves, our sacred temple
Sing the praises of no flag, we set the tone
This is no fiction, we've come to an end now
Our conviction untouched, we build a life straight
Intelligence of heart as only guidance

Infinite power lies all around us and in the heart
The flashes find a way, stealing through these broken walls
And when this fire grows, it does it so we can remember
The meaning of this life, we'll be marching until the end

Had no taste for more lies, we are standing alone
The bright treasure we found has no price and no name
In the light of this star, with the forces aligned

This is how we talk to the world
Pure liquid fire running through our veins
We're in this alone, we bow to no one
Carved by the waves, our sacred temple
Sing the praises of no flag, we set the tone
This is no fiction, we've come to an end now
Our conviction untouched, we build a life straight
Intelligence of the heart as only guidance
